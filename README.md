# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Underwater-Wireless-Sensor-Network-Simulation
This repository contains the code for the network simulation used in the paper "An Oil Detection Approach for Smart Oceans". The paper was accepted and published in IEEE Sensors Journal in May 2020. The algorithm is written Python and works on the basic principle of human evolution and survival of the fittest.
